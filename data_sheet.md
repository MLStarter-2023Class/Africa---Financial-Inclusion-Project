# Datasheet Template

As far as you can, complete the model datasheet. If you have got the data from the internet, you may not have all the information you need, but make sure you include all the information you do have. 

## Motivation

- For what purpose was the dataset created? 
The main dataset was created to predict is person has bank account.

- Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? Who funded the creation of the dataset?
The source data was gathered by Finscope surveys ranging from 2016 to 2018 in four African countries - Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.
 
## Composition

- What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? 
Data represents demographic information of 33,600 people from the four African countries.
- How many instances of each type are there? 
33,600
- Is there any missing data?
no missing data
- Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by    doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?
No, data doesn't contain PII information.

## Collection process

- How was the data acquired? 
- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy? 
Data for the model was extracted from the wider survey. NBo information about extraction process is available.
- Over what time frame was the data collected?
Data collected between 2016 and 2018.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. 
- Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? 
 
## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for? 
- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
n/a
## Distribution

- How has the dataset already been distributed? 
Data avaiulable on internet.
- Is it subject to any copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)?  
no
## Maintenance

- Who maintains the dataset?
