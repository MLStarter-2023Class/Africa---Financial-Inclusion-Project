# Datasheet Template

As far as you can, complete the model datasheet. If you have got the data from the internet, you may not have all the information you need, but make sure you include all the information you do have. 

## Motivation

The main dataset was created to predict is person has bank account.

The source data was gathered by Finscope surveys ranging from 2016 to 2018 in four African countries - Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.
 
## Composition

Data represents demographic information of 33,600 people from the four African countries.

There is no misisng data.

Data doesn't contain PII information.

## Collection process

- How was the data acquired? 
- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy? 
Data for the model was extracted from the wider survey. NBo information about extraction process is available.
- Over what time frame was the data collected?
Data collected between 2016 and 2018.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. 
- Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? 
 
## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for? 
- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
n/a
## Distribution

- How has the dataset already been distributed? 
Data avaiulable on internet.
- Is it subject to any copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)?  
no
## Maintenance

- Who maintains the dataset?
